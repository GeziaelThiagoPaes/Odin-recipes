    <h2>Description</h1>
        <p>This is a rich and creamy eggnog that is an alternative to traditional eggnog, because the eggs are cooked.
            When served chilled and topped with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkling of nutmeg and cinnamon, it is
            a sure bet that it will be a hit at your next Christmas party. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 eggs</li>
            <li>&#189; cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 quarts milk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>&#188; teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>

            <li>
                Place the eggs and sugar into a pan, and whisk until light colored and frothy. Whisk in 2 cups of milk
                until thoroughly blended. Place the pan over medium heat, continuing to stir until the mixture thickens,
                and coats the back of a wooden spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, and allow to stand 5
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the remaining 6 cups of milk, vanilla extract, and nutmeg. Refrigerate at least 2 hours to cool thoroughly before serving.</li>
